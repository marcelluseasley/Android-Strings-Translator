# Android-Strings-Translator

This application takes your default strings.xml file (right now just a variable containging xml) and parses the text from the nodes.
The text is restructured for the Bing Translator API, where it is translated to as many languages as you'd like.

The API requires that you have a client id and client secret code before use.
